### Bridge to Terabithia

Two best friends, Jess and Leslie, create an imaginary kingdom called Terabithia where they escape the struggles of the real world, filling each other’s lives with creativity, love, and belonging. But when tragedy strikes and Leslie is suddenly taken from Jess, he is left with the painful lesson that some friendships, no matter how special, are fleeting. In the end, Jess learns to carry Leslie’s spirit with him, using the love and lessons she gave him to navigate life, proving that while some people may leave, the impact they have on our hearts lasts forever. 

## "Fill them with love, then leave."
